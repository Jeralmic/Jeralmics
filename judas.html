A roguelite where you play as the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to forge or betray alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you destroyed, or will you let it all burn?

<h2>Breakdown</h2>

<p>My first industry experience. I interned at Ghost Story the summer after high school, working remotely with the team on environment art and level design.</p>

<p>I spent most of my time sourcing reference images and preparing them for legal review, hundreds of photos of industrial spaces, machinery, signage. I also designed a combat encounter layout and built 3D blockouts for the garage level computers.</p>

<p>Jonathan Loporto, my high school teacher, made this possible. Leonie, Lucas, Shawn, and Chad mentored me throughout. I learned more in those two months than I had in the past year of solo projects.</p>

<h2>Key Accomplishments</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Sourced and organized reference art for environment teams</li>
    <li>Prepared assets for legal and copyright review</li>
    <li>Designed and iterated on a combat encounter layout</li>
    <li>Created 3D blockouts for garage level environment assets</li>
</ul>
