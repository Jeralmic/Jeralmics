A roguelite where you play as the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to forge or betray alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you destroyed, or will you let it all burn?

<h2>My Contribution</h2>

During my summer at Ghost Story Games, I contributed to the project through:

<ul>
    <li>Creating 3D blockouts of garage level computers</li>
    <li>Sourcing references from artists for copyright approval</li>
    <li>Designing combat level layout</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reflections</h2>

<p>Working on Judas was an incredible experience. I learned so much from the team and grew significantly as a designer and artist during my time there.</p>

<p>I'm grateful for the mentorship I received from Leonie, Lucas, Shawn, and Chad throughout my internship at Ghost Story Games. Their guidance shaped my approach to game development and pushed me to grow.</p>
