A roguelite immersive sim from Ghost Story Games where you play as Judas, forging or betraying alliances aboard a decaying space station.

<h2>Breakdown</h2>

<p>I worked at Ghost Story Games for the summer on environment art and level design.</p>

<p>I blocked out retro computers, desks, and miscellaneous props for the garage level in 3ds Max and Maya. I also designed a combat encounter using server racks as obstacles and water pipes as environmental hazards.</p>

<p>Leonie, Lucas, Shawn, and Chad mentored me throughout my time there. I learned how immersive sims actually get built, how spaces tell stories through the enviroment.</p>

<p>Jonathan Loporto made this opportunity happen. That summer changed how I approach game development.</p>

<h2>Key Accomplishments</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Created 3D blockouts for garage level props and furniture</li>
    <li>Designed combat encounter using environmental hazards</li>
    <li>Sourced and organized reference imagery for environment teams</li>
    <li>Prepared assets for legal and copyright review</li>
</ul>
