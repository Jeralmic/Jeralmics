<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Judas</strong> is a roguelite where you play as the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to forge or betray alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you destroyed, or will you let it all burn?</p>

<h2>My Contribution</h2>
<p>During my summer at Ghost Story Games, I contributed to the project through:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Creating 3D blockouts of garage level computers</li>
    <li>Sourcing references from artists for copyright approval</li>
    <li>Designing combat level layout</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tech Used</h2>
<p>Unreal Engine 4, Maya & 3ds Max</p>

<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>Working on Judas was both challenging and transformative. My biggest challenge was gaining confidence while working alongside industry professionals I deeply admire. It was intimidating at first, but I learned to trust my skills and contribute meaningfully to the team.</p>

<p>I'm incredibly grateful for the mentorship I received from Leonie, Lucas, Shawn, and Chad throughout my time at Ghost Story Games. Their guidance helped shape my approach to game development and pushed me to grow as a artist/designer.</p>
