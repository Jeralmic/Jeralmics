A roguelite where you play as the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to forge or betray alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you destroyed, or will you let it all burn?

<h2>Breakdown</h2>

<p>I started at Ghost Story a few weekx after turning 18, right out of high school. I worked remotely that summer and spent pretty much all day every day on Judas, finding reference art, preparing assets for legal review, designing a small level, modeling blockout items, learning from the project.</p>

<p>I made mistakes. Looking back there are things I definitely should've handled differently. But I was learning in a professional environment I was lucky to be in, and the team was patient with me. Leonie, Lucas, Shawn, and Chad all shaped how I think about making games.</p>

<p>I didn't want it to end.</p>

<p>The opportunity came through Jonathan Loporto, my high school teacher who ran a class on programming and game dev. He saw something in me and helped me get there.</p>

<h2>Key Accomplishments</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Sourced and organized reference art for environment teams</li>

</ul>
