<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>Built a raytracer from scratch in C++, implementing ray-sphere intersection, lighting models, and reflection/refraction. Features realistic shadows, anti-aliasing, and multiple material types.</p>

<h2>Key Accomplishments</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Implemented core ray tracing algorithm without external libraries</li>
    <li>Achieved realistic lighting and shadow effects through physically-based rendering</li>
    <li>Optimized rendering performance through spatial partitioning techniques</li>
    <li>Rendered complex scenes with multiple objects, materials, and light sources</li>
    <li>Developed deep understanding of 3D graphics mathematics and rendering pipelines</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tech Used</h2>
