A puzzle game where players control a rat totem, eating cheese scattered throughout mazes.

<h2>Breakdown</h2>

<p>I'd made games before but never a puzzle game, and puzzle design is genuinely hard. When a puzzle themed jam came up, I teamed with my friend Josiah thinking it'd be a good way to finally learn.</p>

<p>My initial pitch was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban" target="_blank">sokoban</a> but instead of pushing blocks, you're collecting them. You'd control this tall stack of shapes that drops one block at a time as you move through the level. We started building it, got about halfway through, and realized we just couldn't do it justice in the time we had. So we pivoted.</p>

<p>We kept the tall stack idea but simplified everything else. The the visuals needed rethinking since players had to understand what was happening at a glance. That's when I noticed our stack kind of looked like those cursed long <a href="https://i.insider.com/5db1ce34e94e8668eb247624?width=1200&format=jpeg" target="_blank">furbies</a>, which was definitely not the vibe. So I went the opposite direction, long pink rat with big eyes, collecting cheese. Much cuter.</p>

<p>The minimal art style came out of pure necessity since we had no time for anything elaborate. I'd been messing around with orthographic cameras in Unreal for a while, and the flat but-3D look just worked. Sometimes constraints make the decisions for you.</p>
