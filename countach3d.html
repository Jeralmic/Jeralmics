A full vehicle model of the Lamborghini Countach, built in two weeks.

<h2>Breakdown</h2>

<p>This came out of a communications class where the assignment was to explain something you're interested in to people who know nothing about it. I figured it'd be a good excuse to break down how 3D modeling actually works.</p>

<p>I'd tried modeling cars before but never actually finished one, there's always another detail to add. This time I gave myself a hard two-week deadline with no extensions, which changed how I approached everything. I had to ask myself what actually matters, what reads from a distance, and what's invisible unless you're zoomed in way too far. Since my audience wasn't artists, I could get away with a lot more.</p>

<p>The Countach made sense as a subject because those sharp angles and that geometric silhouette are so iconic.</p>

<p>I can still see all the imperfections when I look at it, like the blurred glass hiding the fact that there's no interior because I ran out of time. But from a normal viewing distance it reads as a Countach, and that's what matters.</p>
